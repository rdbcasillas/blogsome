*Lecturing is bloodletting* is a phrase I stole from the Nobel prize winner Carl Weiman. He [explains](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/04/14/465729968/a-nobel-laureates-education-plea-revolutionize-teaching):

> "It's a very good analogy," the Stanford professor says. "You let some blood out and go away and they get well. Was it bloodletting that did it, or something else?"

> "You give people lectures, and [some students] go away and learn the stuff. But it wasn't that they learned it from lecture â€” they learned it from homework, from assignments. When we measure how little people learn from an actual lecture, it's just really small."

But of course, it is not just the lecturing. The incentives in our education systems are designed to discourage curiosity and true learning. They are designed to 
get better grades. They are designed to get jobs. They are a relic of industrial revolution where all we cared for is manufacturing workers. "Intellectuals" were supposed to introspect and write about "deep" topics, not your regular Joe. Joe needs to get a job and feed his family, that is all. 

I believe that 21st century will be the century in which we come to our senses when it comes to understanding and answering the question "What does it mean to educate?" Not only will we come up with better techniques to teach and preserve the natural curiosity in children and adults that our schools (and consequentally our society) tragically extinguish, we will also incorporate essential knowledge from domains like psychology, sociology and cognitive sciences to provide an education that helps children better understand the human condition. 

The purpose of this blog is threefold

* Discuss exciting research in the fields that are trying to understand better ways to enhance learning and transform our education systems. This will involve venturing into the journals that cover educational psychology, computers and their role in education, science behind the act of learning and outcomes from experiments with alternative teaching methods. 

* Explore independent projects and ideas from outside of traditional academia that provide a window into non-traditional methods of teaching and learning. These would include [educational games](http://www.zachtronics.com/index.html) (software or hardware), [explorable explanations](https://explorabl.es/), [video essays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw), [blogs/books](https://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/0465046746), [startups](https://www.thebetterindia.com/179905/india-new-education-preschool-primary-curriculum-startup/) and everything remotely related to improving education.

* Share my own experiments, experiences and ideas. If I am lucky, share conversations with people who are actively teaching or innovating in this field. 

Maybe starting a blog in the social media era of retweets and likes does not make sense. A Youtube channel is probably more likely to be succesful in spreading the message across. But succesful or not, I don't think I can use any other medium than having my own website to fulfull aforementioned purposes. All I can hope for is that my futureself will be consistent and not bothered by lack of traffic. 

Onward.
